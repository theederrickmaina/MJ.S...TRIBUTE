    Up to this date, I can't believe that MJ is gone forever. I know it seems pathetic but the guy was like a mentor to me. 
    I grew up listening to him majorly because of my father's influence. True to the fact, that guy was awesome. 
    If there is anyone out there who didn't like the guy I'd question their taste in music and mentors. 
    Michael Jackson inspired me to sing and dance. Though I'm not an incredible dancer at this current time...lol... 
    but at least I can break some moves. I remember a time in primary school where we had a breakdancing competition and my 
    classmates called out to me to represent them...lol... People noticed me in school because of something Michael Jackson left in me. 
    Even though he never knew me, Michael Jackson's music inspired my soul. He's partly the reason why 
    I have been able to tolerate life up to this far that I have come.

    He brought happiness to our family. Everyone in our household loved MJ including my mum, dad, and brother. I remember having fun moments 
    with my dad as we break-danced to Michael Jackson's music...lol... I was a better dancer than my dad obviously and I still am...lol... 
    And for this reason, I know his soul is resting somewhere in peace and tranquility watching down on us and seeing how people thank him 
    for how he impacted their lives differently.

    It was a saddening moment, waking up one morning at the age of 6 and finding out that your mentor is gone forever. It really broke my 
    little heart. But Michael Jackson's death made me realize one thing,
     <em style="color: red;">'Do whatever you love with all your heart and you will forever be remembered for it.'</em>
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: large;">
    His legacy lives on up to this date and I too will always play a part in it. I will live my life holding on to the lessons that Michael 
    taught me and I will hold them forever in my heart. I'll love whatever I do with all my heart and with the lessons I've learned 
    I'll pass them down to my children. A true inspiration he was. I pray to God that his soul lays forever in eternal piece.
